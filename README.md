# Airport_Operation_and_Manpower_Analytics
Data Analysis Project Showcasing Airport operation and manpower analytics Using Python, Sql and Power Bi

**Overview**

An end-to-end analytics project that analyzes airport operations, flight delays, and manpower workload to support better staffing and operational decisions.
The project uses SQL, Python, and Power BI to convert raw airport data into clear KPIs, insights, and interactive dashboards.
Goal: Reduce delays, optimize manpower utilization, and improve airport efficiency.

**Business Problem**


**Airports manage:**

High flight volume

Multiple terminals

Limited manpower


**Poor manpower allocation causes:**

Increased delays

Higher operational risk

Staff workload imbalance


**This project answers:**

What is happening? → KPIs

Where are delays? → Terminal analysis

Why do delays increase? → Workload vs Delay

When does workload peak? → Time trends


**Tools Used**

Power BI – Dashboards, KPIs, DAX, slicers

SQL – Data joins, workload & delay analysis

Python (Jupyter) – Data cleaning & EDA

CSV Dataset – Airport operations data


**Project Files**

Airport operation and Manpower optimization.pbix
→ Interactive Power BI dashboard

Manpower & Roster Optimization.sql
→ SQL queries for workload & delay analysis

Airport Operation and Manpower Analytics.ipynb
→ Data cleaning and exploratory analysis

airport_analysis.csv
